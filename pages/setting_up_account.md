# Setting up your Account 

---

If you do not already have a Jargon account, you can create an account in order to create, use and share domains on the public Jargon site.

## Creating an account with Jargon

1. Go to the [Jargon signup page](https://jargon.sh/signup)
2. In the Sign Up form, fill in the following:
 - **Username:** This will be how you are identified to others on Jargon, and forms part of how your domains are imported by others. Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores '_' only. 
 - **Email address:** You will need to verify that you own this email address, but we won't share it with others. We might send you the occasional update here as well.
 - **Password:** Your password must meet our password guidelines.
3. Click Signup 
4. Verify your email address by clicking on the link we've sent you. Please check your spam folder, or re-send the verification code if it hasn't arrived yet.
