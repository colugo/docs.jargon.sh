# What is a Domain 

Jargon is inspired by a popular Software Engineering approach to breaking down complexity, called  [Domain-Driven-Design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), and shares many of the same concepts.

Under Domain-Driven-Design, a Domain is;

?> A sphere of knowledge or activity, representing the business problem you are building a solution for

Taking a common example, if you were building a solution for an e-commerce platform, you could break it down into several Domains:

1. **Customer**

2. **Order**

3. **Shipping**

4. **Payment**

Each of these is a contained sphere of activity, and stands alone from any of the other Domains.


In order to make your Domains reusable for others, you should break them down into their smallest subject area possible.
