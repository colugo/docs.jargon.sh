# API Paths 

---

Jargon lets you define different traversals through a Domain to create API Paths.


## How to use the API Path Sidebar

1. Click the API Path button in the Toolbar
2. Use the Left and Right arrow buttons to scroll through the available API Path roots . In the lower right corner of the Sidebar you can see what number API Path you are on, and how many there are in total. These numbers have no meaning, and just make it easier to scroll.

## Creating a new API Path
1. Click the API Path button in the Sidebar
2. If no API Paths exist, click the 'Add a API Path' link at the top of the Sidebar
3. Otherwise, click the '+' button in the lower right corner of the Sidebar
3. Select the root Class in your Domain that this API Path will start from.
3.1 You can optionally also set a prefix that this API path will have, and pre-populate the API Path with some sample operations.
4. The API Path Sidebar will update to show you the name of this API Path root.
5. Click the new 'Add a path to this group' button.
6. You will now be presented with a screen to customise the path.
6.1 You can choose the properties this path will traverse through the model, starting at the root. As you type the names of properties into the topmost box, Jargon will present you with the properties that match. You can go as deep as you need, following the dot-notation path through the Domain.
7. The remainder of the options on the screen change the features of the API specification that is generated from this path.
8. Click the save button when you are done.


## Deleting a API Path
