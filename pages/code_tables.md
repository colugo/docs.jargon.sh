# Code Tables 

---

Jargon manages reference data as multi-dimensional Code Tables, instead of single-dimensional code lists. Here is how you go about it.

## Using the Code Tables Sidebar

To edit, delete or view Code Tables:

1. Click the Code Tables button in the Toolbar

## Creating a new Code Table

1. Click 'Add a code table' link in the Code Table Sidebar
2. Enter a name for the code table. Only letters, numbers, and undersocres '_' are allowed
3. Find the new Code Table in the list in the Code Table Sidebar, and click its pencil button
4. You can change the Code Table's name by chaning the input box at the top
5. Click the cell you want to change and start typing. If you type a value into the last row or collumn, a new ro or collumn will be added at the end. Keep adding new rows or collumns as you need them.
6. The new Code Table will have 3 templated Columns:  Name, Value and Description. Change or delete them to suit your needs.
7. Either Save or Cancel your changes.

## Importing from CSV

Instead of manually typing and managing your code tables, you can import them from a CSV file - but only with a ',' delimeter.

1. Find the Code Table in the list in the Code Table Sidebar, and click its pencil button
2. Paste your CSV data into the text box above the code table
3. Press the 'Parse' button
4. If your data is well-formed, then the CSV data will overwrite the data in the table
