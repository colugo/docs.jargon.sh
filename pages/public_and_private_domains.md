# Public and Private Domains 

---

Jargon is a platform for the public development and sharing of Domains, where the community can participate together.

This isn't always appropriate for everyone, and Jargon allows paying customers to make some of their Domains private.

Here is how that works:


## Public Domains 

- Everyone on the internet can see Public Domains
- Only the account that owns the Domain can edit it
- All Jargon users can create and comment on issues on any Public Domain

## Private Domains

- Only the account that created a Private Domain can see it
- Only the account that owns the Domain can edit it
- If the account is a Team, then any member of the Team can see it, and edit it - based on their role within the team


## Team Accounts

- Every member of a Team can see the Private Domains of the Team
- Teams have Role Based Access Control, limiting what different people can do within a Team:
  - **Admins** Have full control over the team, including adding members and setting roles
  - **Steward** Can create Domains and Releases 
  - **Member** Can modify Domains and create snapshots
  - **Read-Only** Can see everything but change nothing. Able to create and comment on issues. 

### Read-Only Members

Read-Only members are free, and don't contribute towards the number of seats an account has paid for.
The number of Read-Only members is capped at 2x the number of paid seats.

For example, if a Team has paid for 7 seats, they can add 14 Read-Only members.
