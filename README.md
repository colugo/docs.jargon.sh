Hello! :tada:

If you’re into APIs, data modelling or vocabulary development, then Jargon is for you.

It’s a semantic modelling platform, that focusses on sharing and model re-use, making it easier to create interoperable data.

We started Jargon with the vision of creating a data revolution, where data models are available for consumers to find and reuse. We’ve always loved the way that GitHub and NPM have created platforms for the developer community to get together and build off each other’s work.
With Jargon, we’re trying to do the same for data.

With all the same great sharing, re-use, versioning and community features that you’ve come to expect from your online platforms, Jargon is our vision for how the open-source philosophy can work for data modelling.

Here’s a highlight of some of Jargon’s best features so far:
- Create and publish unlimited public Data models
- Generate OpenAPI specifications
- Import and reuse Classes, Members, and Code Tables from any model on the platform
- Semantically versioned release management, so you can trust and rely on the models you import
- Create state lifecycle diagrams for your Classes
- Create specification pages to describe your domains and how they work

## Where to start
- Start with learning about [Domains](pages/domains), and the [language Jargon uses](pages/language) to describe them
