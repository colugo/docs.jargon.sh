# Jargon Docs 

> Hey, thanks for checking out Jargon. You're one step closer to having better data :tada:


## What it is 

Jargon is a platform to create, share and reuse data models. It's inspired by a popular Software Engineering approach to breaking down complexity, called  [Domain-Driven-Design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), and shares many of the same concepts.


## Features
- Automatic [classification of Classes](/pages/language?id=colours-and-class-types) into different Addressability strategies 
- Two-dimensional Code Tables for Reference Data 
- Release and Version Management
- Import Classes and Data-Definitions from other Domains


## Examples

- example 1
- example 2

You can also look at the most imported domains [here](https://jargon.sh/browse)


?> This boilerplate will give you ready made and customizable code, ready to deploy
