# Getting Started 

> Hey, thanks for checking out Jargon. You're one step closer to having better data :tada:


## What it is 

Jargon is a platform to create, share and reuse data models. It's inspired by a popular Software Engineering approach to breaking down complexity, called  [Domain-Driven-Design](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), and shares many of the same concepts.


## Where to start
- Start with learning about [Domains](pages/domains), and the [language Jargon uses](pages/language) to describes them
- Learn about how to use the [Jargon Editor](pages/the_jargon_editor)


## Features
- Automatic [classification of Classes](/pages/language?id=colours-and-class-types) into different Addressability strategies 
- Two-dimensional Code Tables for Reference Data 
- Release and Version Management
- Import Classes and Data-Definitions from other Domains


## Examples
Take a look at the [Domains that have been imported the most](https://jargon.sh/browse)
